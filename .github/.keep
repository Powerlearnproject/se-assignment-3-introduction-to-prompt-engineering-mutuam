Prompt Tuning:

    Types of Prompts:
Open-ended Prompts:

Description: These prompts allow the AI model to generate creative and unrestricted responses. They typically do not impose specific constraints on the content or structure of the response.
Example: "Write a short story about an adventure in space."
Instructional Prompts:

Description: Instructional prompts provide clear instructions or tasks for the AI model to follow. They often specify what the model is expected to generate or perform.
Example: "Translate the following text from English to Spanish: 'Hello, how are you?'

Conditional Prompts:

Description: Conditional prompts include conditions or constraints that influence how the AI model generates its response. The response may vary depending on the conditions specified.
Example: "If the temperature is below freezing, suggest winter clothing options."
Interactive Prompts:

Description: Interactive prompts engage users in a dialogue or conversation with the AI model. They typically involve multiple turns or exchanges to gather information or provide responses.
Example: "Ask the AI model questions about famous historical events and their significance."

Influence of Prompt Types on AI Model's Response:
       Creativity vs. Specificity
